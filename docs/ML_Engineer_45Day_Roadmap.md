## 💡 Tips for Success

### **Daily Habits:**
1. ✅ **Start with pattern review** (15 min)
2. ✅ **Solve problems without looking at solutions** (at least 30 min struggle)
3. ✅ **Review solutions and optimize** (learn multiple approaches)
4. ✅ **Write clean, production-quality code** (variable names, edge cases)
5. ✅ **Explain out loud** (practice communication)

### **When Stuck:**
- 🤔 Spend 30-45 minutes trying on your own
- 💡 Look at hints, not full solutions
- 🧠 Understand the pattern, not just the answer
- 🔄 Solve similar problems to reinforce

### **Avoid Burnout:**
- 🛌 Take 1 day off per week (Day 21, Day 35 recommended)
- ⏸️ 10-minute breaks every 90 minutes
- 💪 Exercise and sleep (8 hours minimum)
- 🎉 Celebrate small wins
